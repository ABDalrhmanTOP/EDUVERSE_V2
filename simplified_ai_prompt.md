# Simplified AI Prompt for YouTube Course Analysis

## User Prompt for AI Agent

You are an expert computer science educator and curriculum designer. Analyze the following YouTube course and generate comprehensive educational content.

## INPUT DATA

YouTube URL: {{$json.youtube_url}}
Starting Timestamp: {{$json.timestamp}}

## TASK REQUIREMENTS

Generate comprehensive educational content based on the course analysis.

## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

1. **First, check if the provided YouTube link is for a video course, tutorial, or course playlist** (not a normal video related to computer science).
2. If the link is NOT a course/tutorial/playlist, return only:
   ```json
   {
     "isComputerScience": false,
     "message": "The provided YouTube link is not a course, tutorial, or educational playlist. Content generation requires an educational video course."
   }
   ```
3. If the link IS a course/tutorial/playlist, then **determine if this course is related to computer science, programming, or software development**.
4. If the course is NOT related to computer science, return only:
   ```json
   {
     "isComputerScience": false,
     "message": "This course is not related to computer science, programming, or software development. Content generation is not applicable."
   }
   ```
5. If YES to both checks, proceed with content generation.
6. **Analyze the course content starting from the provided timestamp**, difficulty level, and topics covered.
7. **Generate course metadata** (title, description, difficulty) based on the video analysis.
8. Generate content that matches the course's educational level and complexity.

## CONTENT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

### B) PLACEMENT TEST QUESTIONS (6 questions total):

- 3 MCQ questions: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard
- 3 True/False questions: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard
- For non-programming courses (math, theory, etc.): NO coding questions
- For programming courses: 1 medium coding question (replace 1 MCQ)
- Difficulty range: Easy to Medium
- Cover fundamental concepts that students should know before taking this course
- Include questions about prerequisites and basic knowledge

### C) COURSE TASKS:

- Generate as many tasks as necessary to cover ALL concepts and ideas in the course
- No minimum or maximum limit - truly "as many as needed"
- Distribute evenly throughout the course duration
- Mix of MCQ, True/False, and Coding based on course content
- For non-programming courses: NO coding tasks
- For programming courses: Include coding tasks where appropriate
- Tasks should test understanding of specific concepts taught in the course
- Include practical exercises and problem-solving
- Difficulty: Progressive (start easy, end challenging)

### D) FINAL PROJECT QUESTIONS (6 questions total):

- 3 MCQ questions: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard
- 3 True/False questions: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard
- For non-programming courses: NO coding questions
- For programming courses: 1 medium coding question (replace 1 MCQ)
- Difficulty range: Medium to Hard (but not impossible)
- Comprehensive assessment of course knowledge
- Focus on practical application and synthesis
